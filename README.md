import mixed data types and using svm and decision tree
Build a solution in the programming language of (Python ) that predicts if the patients will suffer from stroke or not (use 70:30 split between your train and test datasets). Thanks to that the hospital can identify patients with high risk of stroke and sent them for proper treatment
We dont have reliable data which can be used for prediction of stroke. No information of past history. I used a simple assumptions that first variables contain information which can be used to predict last variable. This is very simplistic- we should have time series data, of the state of patient before stroke and more relavent variables. We can see confusion matrix to verify the results.
