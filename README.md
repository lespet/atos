importing mixed data types and using pandas, svm and decision tree for decision.
Build a solution in the programming language of (Python ) that predicts if the patients will suffer from stroke or not (use 70:30 split between your train and test datasets). Thanks to that the hospital can identify patients with high risk of stroke and sent them for proper treatment
We dont have reliable, long data which can be used for prediction of stroke. Data is unbalanced. No information of past history. I used a simple assumptions that first variables contain information which can be used to predict last variable. This is very simplistic- we should have time series data ,monitoring state of patient, knowledge of the predicive variables of state of patient before stroke and more relavent variables. We can see confusion matrix to verify the results. I used 2 methods, svm and decision tree.
